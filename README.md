## What Topics Are Covered in the Tutorials?

The tutorials cover a variety of topics starting from basic onboarding tasks to creating development pipelines.

### Basic Group of Tutorials

The basic group of tutorials covers the following steps for the Cloud Foundry and Kyma runtimes:

- Setting up the development environment
- Building a CAP application with SAP Fiori Elements user interface and a custom logic
- Adding local launchpad, authorization and tests for local development
- Deploying the application in a productive account
- Setting up continuous integration and delivery pipeline
