## You will learn

- How to configure entitlements
- How to enable the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime in your subaccount in SAP BTP
- How to create an SAP HANA Cloud service instance in the SAP BTP cockpit

## Prerequisites

- You have set up the Incident Management sample application. You can choose from two alternative options:
    - Follow the tutorials in the [Develop a Full-Stack CAP Application Following SAP BTP Developerâ€™s Guide](https://developers.sap.com/group.cap-application-full-stack.html) group to develop the application from scratch. 
    - Go to the Incident Management application GitHub repository directly and clone the application without going through the application development steps. See [Incident Management](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app/tree/beginner-tutorials).
- You have an [enterprise global account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/getting-global-account#loiod61c2819034b48e68145c45c36acba6e) in SAP BTP. To use services for free, you can sign up for an SAP BTPEA (SAP BTP Enterprise Agreement) or a Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP global account and make use of the free tier services only. See [Using Free Service Plans](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/using-free-service-plans?version=Cloud).
- You have a platform user. See [User and Member Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/user-and-member-management).
- You are an administrator of the global account in SAP BTP.
- You have a subaccount in SAP BTP to deploy the services and applications.
- You have a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services. See [Get Your Tenant](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/get-your-tenant) for details how to get a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services if you don't have one yet.
- You have established trust between your tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services and your SAP BTP account. This will allow you to use your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant as an identity provider or a proxy to your own identity provider hosting your business users. See [Establish Trust and Federation Between SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service and SAP Cloud Identity Services](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/establish-trust-and-federation-between-uaa-and-identity-authentication).
- You have one of the following browsers that are supported for working in SAP Business Application Studio:
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Google Chrome
    - Microsoft Edge

> This tutorial follows the guidance provided in the [SAP BTP Developer's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/what-is-btp-developers-guide).

### Configure the entitlements

### Enable SAP BTP, Kyma runtime

This enables your subaccount to use the Kyma runtime.

1. Navigate to your subaccount and choose **Enable Kyma** under the **Kyma Environment** tab.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Enable Kyma](./enable-kyma.png)

2. In the **Enable Kyma** popup, change the values for **Instance Name** and **Cluster Name** as needed and choose **Create**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Enable Kyma popup](./enable-kyma-popup.png)


    > Make sure the instance name is CLI-friendly. This will make it easier to manage your instances with the SAP BTP command line interface as well.
    >
    > A CLI-friendly name is a short string (up to 32 characters) that contains only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), periods, underscores, and hyphens. It can't contain white spaces.
    >
    > When enabling the runtime, you'll notice that the instance name is generated automatically for you. You can use that name or replace it with the name of your choice.

### Create an SAP HANA Cloud service instance

SAP HANA Cloud is used as a persistence layer.

Follow these steps to create an SAP HANA Cloud service instance in the SAP BTP cockpit:

1. In your SAP BTP subaccount, navigate to **Services** &rarr; **Instances and Subscriptions** in the left-hand pane.

2. Choose **SAP HANA Cloud**. You'll be redirected to SAP HANA Cloud multi-environment administration tools. Sign in with your SAP BTP cockpit username/e-mail if required.

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![SAP HANA Cloud Go to application](./hana-goto-app.png)

3. In SAP HANA Cloud Central, choose **Create Instance**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![SAP HANA Cloud create instance](./hana-create-instance.png)

7. Choose **SAP HANA Cloud**, **SAP HANA Database**, and then choose **Next Step**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create SAP HANA DB Step 1](./create-hana-db1.png)

8. In the **Instance Name** field, enter **incident-management**.

9. In the **Administrator Password** and **Confirm Administrator Password** fields, enter a password for DBADMIN. Choose **Next Step**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create SAP HANA DB Step 2](./create-hana-db2.png)

10. The default settings should be sufficient for the Incident Management application. Choose **Next Step**.

11. At **SAP HANA Database Availability Zone and Replicas**, choose again **Next Step**.

12. Select the **Allow all IP addresses** radio button, and choose **Review and Create** to review your SAP HANA Cloud instance configuration.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create SAP HANA DB Step 3](./create-hana-db3.png)

13. Choose **Create Instance**.

The creation of the database instance can take some minutes to complete.

> Your SAP HANA Cloud service instance will be automatically stopped overnight, according to the server region time zone. That means you need to restart your instance every day before you start working with it.


### Add the SAP BTP Operator module for your Kyma cluster

You need the SAP BTP Operator module to map your SAP HANA Cloud service instance to the Kyma cluster. The module should be added by default when you enabled the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime. Follow these steps to make sure it's enabled:

1. Navigate to your subaccount and choose **Link to dashboard** under the **Kyma Environment** tab.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Open Kyma console](./kyma-console.png)

2. Choose **Modify Modules**.

3. Make sure that **btp-operator** is on the list. If not, choose **Add**. In the new window, check **btp-operator**, and choose **Add**.

> You can find more info in [Add and Delete a Kyma Module](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/enable-and-disable-kyma-module).

### Map your SAP HANA Cloud service instance to your Kyma cluster

1. Go to SAP HANA Cloud Central. If you have closed it, open it again by following these steps: 

      - In your SAP BTP subaccount, navigate to **Services** &rarr; **Instances and Subscriptions**.
      - Choose **SAP HANA Cloud**. You'll be redirected to SAP HANA Cloud multi-environment administration tools. Sign in with your SAP BTP cockpit username/e-mail if required.

2. For the **incident-management** instance, choose **Manage Configuration**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Manage instance configuration](./hana-config.png)

3. Select the **Instance Mapping** tab and choose **Add Mapping**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add instance mapping](./hana-add-mapping.png)

4. Choose **Kyma** from the dropdown under **Environment Type**.

5. Under **Environment Instance ID**, paste the GUID of your Kyma cluster. Here's how to find it:

      - Open your Kyma dashboard.
      - Choose **Namespaces** on the left and choose **kyma-system**. 
      - Navigate to **Configuration** &rarr; **Config Maps** and choose **sap-btp-operator-config**.
      - You can see the GUID of your Kyma cluster in the **CLUSTER_ID** section.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add environment instance ID](./kyma-cluster-id.png)
    
    > If no namespace is provided, the instance is mapped to all namespaces in the cluster.

6. Choose **Review and Save**. In the popup, mark **Apply changes with a restart**, and choose **Save Changes**. 

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Save changes](./hana-save-mapping.png)

      You have mapped your SAP HANA Cloud service instance to your Kyma cluster.

    > For more information, see [Map an SAP HANA Database to another Environment Context](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD/9ae9104a46f74a6583ce5182e7fb20cb/1683421d02474567a54a81615e8e2c48.html) to add a new Cloud foundry or Kyma mapping.
