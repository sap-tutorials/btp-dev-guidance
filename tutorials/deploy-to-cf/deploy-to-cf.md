### Introduction

The SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment allows you to create polyglot cloud applications in Cloud Foundry. It contains the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime, which is based on the open-source application platform managed by the Cloud Foundry Foundation.

The SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment enables you to develop new business applications and business services, supporting multiple runtimes, programming languages, libraries, and services.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry environment, see [Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/cloud-foundry-environment).

### Set up the MTA for deployment

A multitarget application (MTA) is logically a single application comprised of multiple parts created with different technologies, which share the same lifecycle.

The developers of the MTA describe the desired result using the MTA model which contains MTA modules, MTA resources and interdependencies between them. Afterwards, the MTA deployment service validates, orchestrates, and automates the deployment of the MTA, which results in Cloud Foundry (CF) applications, services and SAP-specific contents.

You will use the [Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/) to deploy the Incident Management application. The modules and services are configured in the **mta.yaml** deployment descriptor file.

1. In SAP Business Application Studio, go to your **IncidentManagement** dev space.

    > Make sure the **IncidentManagement** dev space is in status **RUNNING**.

2. From the root of the **INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT** project, choose the burger menu, and then choose **Terminal** &rarr; **New Terminal**.

3. Run the following command to generate the **mta.yaml** deployment descriptor:

    ```bash
    cds add mta
    ```

### Add configuration for SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition

> You can create a CAP project in either Node.js or Java. You have to choose one way or the other and follow through. The tabs **Node.js** and **Java** provide detailed steps for each alternative way.

[OPTION BEGIN [Node.js]]

1. Run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    cds add workzone-standard
    ```


2. Verify that the destinations module `incident-management-destinations` and resource `incident-management-destination` have been added to the **mta.yaml** file without errors:


    ```yaml
    _schema-version: '3.1'
    ...
    module:
      ...
    - name: incident-management-destinations
      type: com.sap.application.content
      requires:
        - name: incident-management-auth
          parameters:
            service-key:
              name: incident-management-auth-key
        - name: incident-management-html5-repo-host
          parameters:
            service-key:
              name: incident-management-html5-repo-host-key
        - name: srv-api
        - name: incident-management-destination
          parameters:
            content-target: true
      build-parameters:
        no-source: true
      parameters:
        content:
          instance:
            existing_destinations_policy: update
            destinations:
              - Name: incident-management-html5-repository
                ServiceInstanceName: incident-management-html5-repo-host
                ServiceKeyName: incident-management-html5-repo-host-key
                sap.cloud.service: incidentmanagement.service
              - Name: incident-management-auth
                Authentication: OAuth2UserTokenExchange
                ServiceInstanceName: incident-management-auth
                ServiceKeyName: incident-management-auth-key
                sap.cloud.service: incidentmanagement.service
        ...
    resources:
      ...
    - name: incident-management-destination
      type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
      parameters:
        service: destination
        service-plan: lite
        config:
          HTML5Runtime_enabled: true
          init_data:
            instance:
              existing_destinations_policy: update
              destinations:
                - Name: incident-management-srv-api
                  URL: ~{srv-api/srv-url}
                  Authentication: NoAuthentication
                  Type: HTTP
                  ProxyType: Internet
                  HTML5.ForwardAuthToken: true
                  HTML5.DynamicDestination: true
                - Name: ui5
                  URL: https://ui5.sap.com
                  Authentication: NoAuthentication
                  Type: HTTP
                  ProxyType: Internet
      requires:
        - name: srv-api
          group: destinations
          properties:
            name: srv-api # must be used in xs-app.json as well
            url: ~{srv-url}
            forwardAuthToken: true
    ```




3. Verify that the navigation target `incidents-display` and the SAP Cloud service `sap.cloud` have been correctly added to the application manifest file **app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json**:


    ```json
    "sap.app": {
      "id": "ns.incidents",
      ...
      "sourceTemplate": {
        ...
      },
      "dataSources": {
        ...
      },
      "crossNavigation": {
        "inbounds": {
          "incidents-display": {
            "semanticObject": "incidents",
            "action": "display",
            "title": "{{flpTitle}}",
            "subTitle": "{{flpSubtitle}}",
            "signature": {
              "parameters": {},
              "additionalParameters": "allowed"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ...
    "sap.cloud": {
        "public": true,
        "service": "incidents"
      }
    }   
    ```


4. Open **app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json** and remove the leading `/` from the `uri` parameter.

    ```json
    {
        "_version": "1.49.0",
        "sap.app": {
            "id": "ns.incidents",
            "type": "application",
            "i18n": "i18n/i18n.properties",
            ...
            "dataSources": {
                "mainService": {
                    "uri": "odata/v4/processor/",
                    "type": "OData",
                    "settings": {
                        "annotations": [],
                        "localUri": "localService/metadata.xml",
                        "odataVersion": "4.0"
                    }
                }
            },
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
    ```

    This is needed as the dataSource URIs must be relative to the base URL, which means there is no need for a slash as the first character.

    Check [Accessing Business Service UI](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/accessing-business-service-ui?locale=39723061bc4b4b679726b120cbefdf5a.html&q=base%20URL) for more information.

5. Make sure that the line `"welcomeFile": "/index.html"` in the following snippet is added to the **app/incidents/xs-app.json** file. Add if it is missing. 

    ```json
    {
      "welcomeFile": "/index.html",
      "authenticationMethod": "route",
      "routes": [
        {
          "source": "^/?odata/(.*)$",
          "target": "/odata/$1",
          "destination": "incident-management-srv-api",
          "authenticationType": "xsuaa",
          "csrfProtection": true
        },
        {
          "source": "^(.*)$",
          "target": "$1",
          "service": "html5-apps-repo-rt",
          "authenticationType": "xsuaa"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Java]]

1. Run the following command in the root folder of your project:

    ```bash
    cds add workzone
    ```

    You should see the following output in the terminal:

    ```bash
    Adding feature 'destination'...
    Adding feature 'html5-repo'...
    Adding feature 'workzone'...
    Adding feature 'workzone-standard'...
    ```

2. Verify that all required modules (`incident-management-app-deployer`, `incidentmanagementincidents`, and `incident-management-destinations`) and resources (`incident-management-destination` and `incident-management-html5-repo-host`) have been added to the **mta.yaml** file without errors:

[OPTION END]

### Make additional changes to the mta.yaml file

[OPTION BEGIN [Node.js]]

1. Update the `incident-management-app-deployer` module (`path`, `build-result`, and `target-path` parameters) as follows:

    ```yaml
    _schema-version: '3.1'
    ...
    module:
      ...
    - name: incident-management-app-deployer
      type: com.sap.application.content
      path: .
      requires:
      - name: incident-management_html_repo_host
        parameters:
          content-target: true
      build-parameters:
        build-result: resources/
        requires:
          - name: incidentmanagementincidents
            artifacts:
              - incidents.zip
            target-path: resources/
            
    - name: incidentmanagementincidents
    ...
    ```

2. Add `mkdir -p resources` command to the `build-parameters` section:

    ```yaml
      build-parameters:
        before-all:
          - builder: custom
            commands:
              - npm ci
              - npx cds build --production
              - mkdir -p resources 
    ```

3. Verify the **mta.yaml** file before deployment.

    This is how your **mta.yaml** file should look like at this stage:

    ```yaml
    _schema-version: 3.3.0
