## You will learn

- How to deploy your CAP application as a multi-target application (MTA)

## Prerequisites

- You've configured the respective entitlements, enabled the Cloud Foundry runtime in your subaccount, and created an SAP HANA Cloud service instance in the SAP BTP cockpit. Follow the steps in the [Prepare for Deployment in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime](prepare-btp-cf) tutorial that is part of the [Deploy a Full-Stack CAP Application in SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime Following SAP BTP Developerâ€™s Guide](https://developers.sap.com/group.deploy-full-stack-cap-application.html) tutorial group.
- You have an [enterprise global account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/getting-global-account#loiod61c2819034b48e68145c45c36acba6e) in SAP BTP. To use services for free, you can sign up for an SAP BTPEA (SAP BTP Enterprise Agreement) or a Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP global account and use the free tier services only. See [Using Free Service Plans](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/using-free-service-plans?version=Cloud).
- You have a platform user. See [User and Member Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/user-and-member-management).
- You're an administrator of the global account in SAP BTP.
- You have a subaccount in SAP BTP to deploy the services and applications.
- You have a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services. See [Get Your Tenant](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/get-your-tenant) for details how to get a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services if you don't have one yet.
- You've established trust between your tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services and your SAP BTP account. This established trust allows you to use your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant as an identity provider or a proxy to your own identity provider hosting your business users. See [Establish Trust and Federation Between SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service and SAP Cloud Identity Services](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/establish-trust-and-federation-between-uaa-and-identity-authentication).
- You have one of the following browsers that are supported for working in SAP Business Application Studio:
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Google Chrome
    - Microsoft Edge

> This tutorial follows the guidance provided in the [SAP BTP Developer's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/what-is-btp-developers-guide).

### Introduction

The SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment allows you to create polyglot cloud applications in Cloud Foundry. It contains the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime, which is based on the open-source application platform managed by the Cloud Foundry Foundation.

The SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment enables you to develop new business applications and business services, supporting multiple runtimes, programming languages, libraries, and services.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry environment, see [Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/cloud-foundry-environment).

### Set up the MTA for deployment

A multi-target application (MTA) is logically a single application comprised of multiple parts created with different technologies, which share the same lifecycle.

The developers of the MTA describe the desired result using the MTA model which contains MTA modules, MTA resources, and interdependencies between them. Afterwards, the MTA deployment service validates, orchestrates, and automates the deployment of the MTA, which results in Cloud Foundry (CF) applications, services, and SAP-specific contents.

You use the [Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/) to deploy the Incident Management application. The modules and services are configured in the **mta.yaml** deployment descriptor file.

1. In SAP Business Application Studio, go to your **IncidentManagement** dev space.

    > Make sure the **IncidentManagement** dev space is in status **RUNNING**.

2. From the root of the **INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT** project, choose the burger menu, and then choose **Terminal** &rarr; **New Terminal**.

3. Run the following command to generate the **mta.yaml** deployment descriptor:

    ```bash
    cds add mta
    ```

### Check configuration for SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition

> You can create a CAP project in either Node.js or Java. You have to choose one way or the other and follow through. The tabs **Node.js** and **Java** provide detailed steps for each alternative way.

### Make additional changes to the mta.yaml file

[OPTION BEGIN [Node.js]]

1. Update the `incident-management-app-deployer` module (`path`, `build-result`, and `target-path` parameters) as follows:

    ```yaml
    _schema-version: '3.1'
    ...
    module:
      ...
    - name: incident-management-app-deployer
      type: com.sap.application.content

### Assemble with the Cloud MTA Build Tool

Run the following commands to assemble everything into a single **mta.tar** archive:

```bash
npm install
mbt build
```

See [Multitarget Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/d04fc0e2ad894545aebfd7126384307c.html?locale=en-US) to learn more about MTA-based deployment.

### Deploy in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime

[OPTION BEGIN [Node.js]]

1. From the root of the **INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT** project, choose the burger menu, and then choose **Terminal** &rarr; **New Terminal**.

2. Log in to your subaccount in SAP BTP:

    ```bash
    cf api <API-ENDPOINT>
    cf login
    cf target -o <ORG> -s <SPACE>
    ```

    > You can find the API endpoint in the **Overview** section of your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit.

3. Run the following command to deploy the generated archive to the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime:

    ```bash
    cf deploy mta_archives/incident-management_1.0.0.mtar 
    ```

4. Check if all services have been created:

    ```bash
    cf services
    ```

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Services after deploy](./cf-services.png)

5. Check if the apps are running:

    ```bash
    cf apps
    ```

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![App after deploy](./cf-apps.png)

<!-- 6. Enter the route displayed for **incident-management-srv** in your browser. -->

<!-- border; size:540px ![Incident Management route](./incident-management-srv-route.png) -->

<!-- undeploy command: `cf undeploy incident-management --delete-service-keys --delete-services` -->

<!-- You see the CAP start page: -->
