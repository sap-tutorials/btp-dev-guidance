## You will learn

- How to configure entitlements.
- How to enable the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry runtime in your subaccount in SAP BTP.
- How to create an SAP HANA Cloud service instance in the SAP BTP cockpit.

## Prerequisites

- You've set up the Incident Management sample application. You can choose from two alternative options:
    - Follow the tutorials in the [Develop a Full-Stack CAP Application Following SAP BTP Developer’s Guide](https://developers.sap.com/group.cap-application-full-stack.html) group to develop the application from the start. 
    - Go to the Incident Management application GitHub repository directly and clone the application without going through the application development steps. See [Incident Management](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app/tree/beginner-tutorials).
- You have an [enterprise global account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/getting-global-account#loiod61c2819034b48e68145c45c36acba6e) in SAP BTP. To use services for free, you can sign up for an SAP BTPEA (SAP BTP Enterprise Agreement) or a Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP global account and use the free tier services only. See [Using Free Service Plans](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/using-free-service-plans?version=Cloud).
- You have a platform user. See [User and Member Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/user-and-member-management).
- You're an administrator of the global account in SAP BTP.
- You have a subaccount in SAP BTP to deploy the services and applications.
- You have a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services. See [Get Your Tenant](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/get-your-tenant) for details how to get a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services if you don't have one yet.
- You've established trust between your tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services and your SAP BTP account. This established trust allows you to use your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant as an identity provider or a proxy to your own identity provider hosting your business users. See [Establish Trust and Federation Between SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service and SAP Cloud Identity Services](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/establish-trust-and-federation-between-uaa-and-identity-authentication).
- You have one of the following browsers that are supported for working in SAP Business Application Studio:
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Google Chrome
    - Microsoft Edge

> This tutorial follows the guidance provided in the [SAP BTP Developer's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/what-is-btp-developers-guide).

<!-- Assign Entitlements start -->

### Configure the entitlements

In this section, you set up the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry runtime for deploying CAP applications.

To deploy the Incident Management applications, you need the following entitlements:

| Service     |      Plan      |  Quota required |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| Cloud Foundry runtime | free (Environment) |   1 |
| SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition    |  free (Application)    |   1 |
| SAP HANA Cloud |   hana-free    |   1 |
| SAP HANA Cloud |   tools (Application)   |   1 |
| SAP HANA Schemas & HDI Containers |   hdi-shared   |   1 |
| SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery | free (Application) |   1 |

If you don't have the entitlements added already, do the following steps to add them.

1. Log in to the SAP BTP cockpit.

2. Navigate to your subaccount and choose **Entitlements** &rarr; **Edit**.

<!-- Assign Entitlements end -->

### Enable Cloud Foundry Runtime

Enabling the Cloud Foundry (CF) runtime creates a CF organization (org.) in your subaccount. There’s always one Cloud Foundry org. per subaccount. Later on, when you log on to Cloud Foundry, it asks you which Cloud Foundry org. you want to log on to. For any development in your subaccount, you need to choose this org. for your subaccount. If you don't have a CF org. created in your subaccount already, do the following steps to create it.

1. Navigate to your subaccount and choose **Enable Cloud Foundry**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![enable CF](./enable-cf.png) 

3. In the **Enable Cloud Foundry** popup, change the values for **Instance Name** and **Org Name** as needed and choose **Create**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![enable CF popup](./enable-cf-popup.png) 


    > Make sure that the instance name is CLI-friendly. CLI-friendly names make it easier to manage your instances with the SAP BTP command-line interface as well.
    >
    > A CLI-friendly name is a short string (up to 32 characters) that contains only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), periods, underscores, and hyphens. It can't contain white spaces.
    >
    > When enabling the runtime, you notice that the instance name is generated automatically for you. You can use that name or replace it with the name of your choice.


3. Navigate to **Cloud Foundry** &rarr; **Spaces** and choose **Create Space**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create space](./cf-createspace.png)

4. Enter a space name (for example, **dev**) and choose **Create**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create space popup](./cf-createspace-popup.png)

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add user](./hana-add-user.png)

    > Keep the setting `Default Identity Provider` unless you have a custom identity provider configured.

13. Choose **Save**.

      You've assigned the **SAP HANA Cloud Administrator** role collection to your user.

> Log out and log back in to make sure your new role collection is considered.

### Create an SAP HANA Cloud service instance

SAP HANA Cloud is used as a persistence layer.

Follow these steps to create an SAP HANA Cloud service instance in the SAP BTP cockpit:

1. In your SAP BTP subaccount, navigate to **Services** &rarr; **Instances and Subscriptions** in the left-hand pane.

2. Choose **SAP HANA Cloud**. You're redirected to SAP HANA Cloud Central. Sign in with your SAP BTP cockpit username/e-mail if necessary.

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![SAP HANA Cloud Go to application](./hana-goto-app.png)

3. In SAP HANA Cloud Central, choose **Create Instance**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![SAP HANA Cloud create instance](./hana-create-instance.png)

7. Select the **Free Tier** tab, then select the **Configure manually** radio button and make sure that the **SAP HANA Database** tab is selected. Choose **Next Step**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create SAP HANA DB Step 1](./create-hana-db1.png)

8. In the **Instance Name** field, enter **incident-management**.

9. In the **Administrator Password** and **Confirm Administrator Password** fields, enter a password for DBADMIN. Choose **Next Step**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create SAP HANA DB Step 2](./create-hana-db2.png)

10. The default settings are sufficient for the Incident Management application. Choose **Next Step**.

11. At **SAP HANA Database Availability Zone and Replicas**, choose again **Next Step**.

12. Select the **Allow all IP addresses** radio button, and choose **Review and Create** to review your SAP HANA Cloud instance configuration.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create SAP HANA DB Step 3](./create-hana-db3.png)

13. Choose **Create Instance**.

The creation of the database instance can take some minutes to complete.

> Your SAP HANA Cloud service instance is automatically stopped overnight, according to the time zone of the region where the server is located. That means you need to restart your instance every day before you start working with it.


### Map your SAP HANA Cloud service instance to your Cloud Foundry organization

1. Go to SAP HANA Cloud Central. If you've closed it, open it again by following these steps: 

      - In your SAP BTP subaccount, navigate to **Services** &rarr; **Instances and Subscriptions**.
      - Choose **SAP HANA Cloud**. You're redirected to SAP HANA Cloud multi-environment administration tools. Sign in with your SAP BTP cockpit username/e-mail if necessary.

2. For the **incident-management** instance, choose **Manage Configuration**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Manage instance configuration](./hana-config.png)

3. Select the **Instance Mapping** tab and choose **Add Mapping**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add instance mapping](./hana-add-mapping.png)

4. Choose **Cloud Foundry** from the dropdown under **Environment Type**.

5. Under **Environment Instance ID**, paste the GUID of your Cloud Foundry organization. Here's how to find it:

      - Open a new terminal in SAP Business Application Studio and log in with `cf login`.
      - Run the command `cf org <Your-Cloud-Foundry-Org> --guid`. You get the GUID of your Cloud Foundry organization in response.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add environment instance ID](./cf-env-instance-id.png)
    
    > If you only specify the organization GUID, the instance is mapped to all spaces in that organization.

5. Choose **Review and Save** and then choose **Save Changes** in the popup. 

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Save changes](./hana-save-mapping.png)

      You've mapped your SAP HANA Cloud service instance to your Cloud Foundry organization.

    > For more information, see [Map an SAP HANA Database to another Environment Context](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD/9ae9104a46f74a6583ce5182e7fb20cb/1683421d02474567a54a81615e8e2c48.html) to add a new Cloud foundry mapping.
