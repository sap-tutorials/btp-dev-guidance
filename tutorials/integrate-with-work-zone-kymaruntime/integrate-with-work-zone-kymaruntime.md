[OPTION BEGIN [Common Data Model]]

The Common Data Model (CDM) is the basis for interoperability and content federation of business content from various SAP and third-party products, all integrated in a unified manner in one site that serves as a central entry point. Business content items such as roles, catalogs, groups, spaces, and pages can be included in the CDM. For this purpose, developers must specify the business content of the site in a **cdm.json** file that is part of the multitarget application (MTA) and also define design-time and runtime destinations in the **mta.yaml** file. For more information, see [Developing HTML5 Business Solutions as Content Providers](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-advanced-edition/sap-build-work-zone-advanced-edition/developing-html5-apps-for-cross-subaccount-consumption) and [About the Common Data Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-advanced-edition/sap-build-work-zone-advanced-edition/creating-cdm-json-file-for-multi-tenancy-html5-app).

#### Update the Chart.yaml file and the values.yaml file

1. Add the following code snippet to **chart/Chart.yaml** file:

    ```yaml
    - name: service-instance
      alias: html5-apps-repo-runtime
      version: ">0.0.0"
    ```

2. Run the following command to automate the setup for HTML5 application deployment:

    ```bash
    cds add html5-repo
    ```

3. Add the following configurations for creating an `html5-apps-repo-runtime` service instance in the **values.yaml** file:

    ```yaml
    html5-apps-repo-runtime: 
      serviceOfferingName: html5-apps-repo
      servicePlanName: app-runtime
    ```

4. Delete the destination configuration from **chart/values.yaml**:

    ```yaml
    destination:
      serviceOfferingName: 'destination'
      servicePlanName: 'lite'
      parameters:
        version: '1.0.0'
        HTML5Runtime_enabled: true
    ```


5. Update the `html5-apps-deployer` section:

    1. Delete the `SAP_CLOUD_SERVICE`line and the lines `destination:` and `serviceInstanceName: destination`:

        ```yaml
        html5-apps-deployer:
          env:
            SAP_CLOUD_SERVICE: incidentmanagementservice
          image:
            repository: "incident-management-html5-deployer"
          bindings:
            xsuaa:
              serviceInstanceName: xsuaa
            destination:
              serviceInstanceName: destination
        ```
    
    2. Delete `envFrom:` and the fields under it:

        ```yaml
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-html5-apps-deployer-configmap"
        ```

    3. Delete `backendDestinations:` and its properties.

    4. Under `env`, add the following:.

        ```yaml[2-3]
          env:
             ASYNC_UPLOAD: "true"
             destinations: '[{"forwardAuthToken":true,"name":"srv-api","url":"https://incident-management-srv-incident-management.<cluster-domain>"}]'
        ```

    > Update the placeholder `<cluster-domain>` with the domain of your Kyma cluster.
    >
    > Run the following command to get your Kyma cluster's domain:
    >
    > ```bash
    > kubectl get gateway -n kyma-system kyma-gateway \
    >        -o jsonpath='{.spec.servers[0].hosts[0]}'
    > ```
    > Add the result without the leading `*.` in the placeholder `<cluster-domain>`.

    
    > You can find the value for `<cloud-service-name>` in the **app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json** file.
    > ```json[3]
    > "sap.cloud": {
    >    "public": true,
    >    "service": "incidents"
    >}
    >```

<!-- 6. Verify. Here's how your **values.yaml** file should look like at this stage: -->
<!--     -->
<!--    ```yaml  -->
<!--    ...      -->
<!--    ```      -->

#### Create the CDM configuration

1. In the **ui-resources/resources** folder, create a new file **cdm.json** and paste the following code snippet in the file:

    ```json
    [
        {
        "_version": "3.0",
        "identification": {
            "id": "defaultCatalogId",

            }
            ]
        },
        "texts": [
            {
            "locale": "",
            "textDictionary": {
                "title": "Default Catalog Title"
            }
            }
        ]
        },
        {

                "vizId": "incidents-display"
            }
            ]
        },
        "texts": [
            {
            "locale": "",
            "textDictionary": {
                "title": "Business Apps"
            }
            }
        ]
        },
        {
        "_version": "3.0",
        "identification": {
            "id": "defaultRole",
            "entityType": "role",
            "title": "Default Role"
        },
        "payload": {
            "apps": [
            {
                "id": "ns.incidents"
            }
            ],
            "catalogs": [
            {
                "id": "defaultCatalogId"
            }
            ],
            "groups": [
            {
                "id": "defaultGroupId"
            }
            ]
        }
        }
    ]
    ```

#### Build the images and deploy your application in SAP BTP, Kyma runtime

1. Build the UI deployer image:

    ```bash
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-html5-deployer:<image-version> \
        --path ui-resources \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
    ```

    > Make sure to replace `<your-container-registry>` with the link to your container registry and keep in mind that `<image version>` should be a string. 
    
    > Looking for your docker server URL?
    
    > The docker server URL is the same as the path used for docker login, so you can quickly check it by running the following command in your terminal:

    > ```json
    > cat ~/.docker/config.json
    > ```

    > In case you're using Docker Hub as your container registry, replace the placeholder `<your-container-registry>` with your Docker Hub user ID.


1. Update the productive CAP build for your application: 

    ```bash
    cds build --production
    ```

3. Deploy using the Helm command:

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install incident-management --namespace incident-management ./gen/chart \
    --set-file xsuaa.jsonParameters=xs-security.json
    ```

    > With the ***helm upgrade --install*** command you can install a new chart as well as upgrade an existing chart.

#### Create destinations

When the application is successfully deployed, you have to configure design and runtime destinations. This enables SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition to configure sites with the application configurations like groups, roles, categories, and so on.
