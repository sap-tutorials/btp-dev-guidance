### Create a repository

To be able to perform the steps for setting up a CI/CD pipeline, you need a public repository. Currently, SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery supports [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) repositories.

For real application development, you need to consider the right place for your repository.

In this example, we're creating a repository on GitHub. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account for this step. Go ahead and create one if you don't have it yet.

1. Create a new GitHub repository in your GitHub account.

1. Under **Repository name**, enter **incident-management**.

2. Choose **Create repository**.

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create repository](./create-repo.png)

3. You're directed to the **Quick Setup** page of your new repository. Make sure to copy the URL of the repository as you'll need it in the next steps.

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Quick Setup](./quick-setup.png)

### Initialize a repository in SAP Business Application Studio

1. In SAP Business Application Studio, navigate to **Source Control** and choose **Initialize Repository**.

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Initialize repository](./initialize-repo.png)

2. In the dropdown **Pick workspace folder to initialize git repo in**, choose the **incident-management** folder.

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Pick workspace folder](./pick-workspace-folder.png)

3. Open the three dots menu next to **Source Control** and choose **Remote** &rarr; **Add Remote...**.

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add remote](./add-remote.png)

4. Paste the URL of your repository in the **Provide repository URL** field and press <kbd>Enter<kbd>.

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Provide repo URL](./provide-repo-url.png)

5. Provide a remote name and press <kbd>Enter<kbd>.

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Provide remote name](./provide-remote-name.png)

6. Stage your changes, add a commit message, and choose **Publish Branch**.

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Publish branch](./publish-branch.png)
