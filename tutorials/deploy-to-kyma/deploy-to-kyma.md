## You will learn

- How to deploy your CAP application in SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.

## Prerequisites

- You've configured the respective entitlements, enabled the Kyma runtime in your subaccount, and created an SAP HANA Cloud service instance in the SAP BTP cockpit. Follow the steps in the [Prepare for Deployment in the SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](prepare-btp-kyma) tutorial that is part of the [Deploy a Full-Stack CAP Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime Following SAP BTP Developer’s Guide](https://developers.sap.com/group.deploy-full-stack-cap-kyma-runtime.html) tutorial group.
- You have an [enterprise global account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/getting-global-account#loiod61c2819034b48e68145c45c36acba6e) in SAP BTP. To use services for free, you can sign up for an SAP BTPEA (SAP BTP Enterprise Agreement) or a Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP global account and use the free tier services only. See [Using Free Service Plans](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/using-free-service-plans?version=Cloud).
- You have a platform user. See [User and Member Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/user-and-member-management).
- You're an administrator of the global account in SAP BTP.
- You have a subaccount in SAP BTP to deploy the services and applications.
- You have a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services. See [Get Your Tenant](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/get-your-tenant) for details how to get a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services if you don't have one yet.
- You've established trust between your tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services and your SAP BTP account. This established trust allows you to use your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant as an identity provider or a proxy to your own identity provider hosting your business users. See [Establish Trust and Federation Between SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service and SAP Cloud Identity Services](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/establish-trust-and-federation-between-uaa-and-identity-authentication).
- You have one of the following browsers that are supported for working in SAP Business Application Studio:
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Google Chrome
    - Microsoft Edge
 - For Windows, you need Chocolatey. Chocolatey is a package manager that speeds up and eases installation of the tools in this tutorial. See how to install Chocolatey in [Setup/Install](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup).
 - You've prepared a container registry and you've logged in to the container registry through your CLI. A container registry is a repo where you can push your Docker images. SAP BTP doesn't currently provide a container registry. You can use any container registry offering as long as it can be reached from the public Internet.

> This tutorial follows the guidance provided in the [SAP BTP Developer's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/what-is-btp-developers-guide).

### Introduction

SAP BTP, Kyma runtime is a cloud-native application runtime that combines the power of Kubernetes with a set of best-in-class tools and open-source components that empower you to develop, run, and operate secure and scalable cloud-native applications. Detailed information is available at [Kyma Environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/kyma-environment).

The files of the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime are provided as a container image. In addition, since the containers run on Kubernetes, their configuration is described by Kubernetes resources.

Hence, you need two kinds of artifacts to run applications on Kubernetes:

- Container images
- Kubernetes resources

You start by building your project as container images and push those images to a container registry of your choice. Then, you add a [CAP Helm chart](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/deployment/deploy-to-kyma#about-cap-helm) to your project. As a last step, you deploy the Helm chart to your Kyma resources, where service instances of SAP BTP services are created and pods pull the previously created container images from the container registry.

### Download and set up the project locally

1. Skip this step if you cloned the application from the [Incident Management application GitHub repository](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app/tree/beginner-tutorials) without going through the application development steps. Perform this step only in case you've developed the application from the start following the tutorials in the [Develop a Full-Stack CAP Application Following SAP BTP Developer’s Guide](https://developers.sap.com/group.cap-application-full-stack.html) group.

    1. In SAP Business Application Studio, choose the icon to download dev space content.

        <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Download dev space content](./downloadproject.png)

        > Make sure the **IncidentManagement** dev space is in status **RUNNING**.

    2. Extract the **incident-management** folder from the downloaded archive.


3. Open a command-line window in the folder where your application resides (for example, **incident-management** if developed from the start or **incidents-app** if cloned from GitHub) and run the following command to open the project in VS Code:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

### Prepare your application

[OPTION BEGIN [Node.js]]
> Make sure you're logged in to your container registry.

1. In VS Code, choose **Terminal** &rarr; **New Terminal** and run the following command:

    This command installs the required dependencies and updates the **package-lock.json** file of your project.

2. In your terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    cds add workzone
    ```

3. Run the following command to get the domain name of your Kyma cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl get gateway -n kyma-system kyma-gateway \
            -o jsonpath='{.spec.servers[0].hosts[0]}'
    ```

    The result looks like this:

    ```bash
    *.<xyz123>.kyma.ondemand.com
    ```

    > `<xyz123>` is a placeholder for a string of characters that's unique for your cluster.

4. Provide a Helm chart:

    ```bash
    cds add kyma
    ```

[OPTION END]
[OPTION BEGIN [Java]]

> Make sure you're logged in to your container registry.

1. In VS Code, choose **Terminal** &rarr; **New Terminal** and run the following command:

    ```

    Provide your container registry and the domain name when prompted.

5. In the VS Code terminal, navigate to the **app/incidents** folder and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install && npm run build
    ```

[OPTION END]

### Deploy the application

[OPTION BEGIN [Node.js]]
1. Run the following command to create a namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace incident-management
    kubectl label namespace incident-management istio-injection=enabled
    ```

2. Run the following command to get the domain name of your Kyma cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl get gateway -n kyma-system kyma-gateway \
            -o jsonpath='{.spec.servers[0].hosts[0]}'
    ```

    The result looks like this:

    ```bash
    *.<xyz123>.kyma.ondemand.com
    ```

    > `<xyz123>` is a placeholder for a string of characters that's unique for your cluster.

3. Make sure that your SAP HANA Cloud instance is running. Free tier HANA instances are stopped overnight.

    > Your SAP HANA Cloud service instance is automatically stopped overnight, according to the time zone of the region where the server is located. That means you need to restart your instance every day before you start working with it.
    >
    > You can either use the SAP BTP cockpit or the terminal in the SAP Business Application Studio to restart the stopped instance:
    >
    > ```bash
    > cf update-service incident-management -c '{"data":{"serviceStopped":false}}'
    > ```

4. Deploy using the `cds up` command:

    ```bash
    cds up -2 k8s --namespace incident-management
    ```

5. You may be asked to create your Docker imagePullSecret. If so, follow the provided instructions.

    The `cds up -2 k8s --namespace incident-management` command installs the Helm chart from the **chart** folder with the release name **incident-management** in the namespace **incident-management**.

    The outcome of the installation looks like this:

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Deployed app](./deployedapp.png)

<!-- 6. Enter the route displayed for **srv** in your browser. -->

<!-- border; size:540px ![Depoyed app route](./deployedapp-route.png) -->
