## You will learn

- How to deploy your CAP application in SAP BTP, Kyma runtime

## Prerequisites

- You have configured the respective entitlements, enabled the Kyma runtime in your subaccount, and created an SAP HANA Cloud service instance in the SAP BTP cockpit. Follow the steps in the [Prepare for Deployment in the SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](prepare-btp-kyma) tutorial that is part of the [Deploy a Full-Stack CAP Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime Following SAP BTP Developerâ€™s Guide](https://developers.sap.com/group.deploy-full-stack-cap-kyma-runtime.html) tutorial group.
- You have an [enterprise global account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/getting-global-account#loiod61c2819034b48e68145c45c36acba6e) in SAP BTP. To use services for free, you can sign up for an SAP BTPEA (SAP BTP Enterprise Agreement) or a Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP global account and make use of the free tier services only. See [Using Free Service Plans](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/using-free-service-plans?version=Cloud).
- You have a platform user. See [User and Member Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/user-and-member-management).
- You are an administrator of the global account in SAP BTP.
- You have a subaccount in SAP BTP to deploy the services and applications.
- You have a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services. See [Get Your Tenant](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/get-your-tenant) for details how to get a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services if you don't have one yet.
- You have established trust between your tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services and your SAP BTP account. This will allow you to use your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant as an identity provider or a proxy to your own identity provider hosting your business users. See [Establish Trust and Federation Between SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service and SAP Cloud Identity Services](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/establish-trust-and-federation-between-uaa-and-identity-authentication).
- You have one of the following browsers that are supported for working in SAP Business Application Studio:
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Google Chrome
    - Microsoft Edge
 - For Windows, you'll need Chocolatey. This is a package manager that will speed up and ease installation of the tools in this tutorial. See how to install Chocolatey in [Setup/Install](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup).
 - You have prepared a container registry and you've logged in to the container registry through your CLI. A container registry is a repo where you can push your Docker images. SAP BTP doesn't currently provide a container registry. You can use any container registry offering as long as it can be reached from public Internet.

> This tutorial follows the guidance provided in the [SAP BTP Developer's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/what-is-btp-developers-guide).

### Introduction

SAP BTP, Kyma runtime is a cloud-native application runtime that combines the power of Kubernetes with a set of best-in-class tools and open-source components that empower you to develop, run, and operate secure and scalable cloud-native applications. Detailed information is available at [Kyma Environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/kyma-environment).

The Kyma runtime for SAP BTP's files are provided as a container image. In addition, since the containers run on Kubernetes, their configuration is described by Kubernetes resources.

Hence, you need two kinds of artifacts to run applications on Kubernetes:

- Container images
- Kubernetes resources

You start by building your project as container images and push those images to a container registry of your choice. Then, you add a [CAP Helm chart](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/deployment/deploy-to-kyma#about-cap-helm) to your project. As a last step, you deploy the Helm chart to your Kyma resources, where service instances of SAP BTP services are created and pods pull the previously created container images from the container registry.

[OPTION END]

### Download and set up the project locally

1. Skip this step if you cloned the application from the [Incident Management application GitHub repository](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app/tree/beginner-tutorials) without going through the application development steps. Perform this step only in case you have developed the application from scratch following the tutorials in the [Develop a Full-Stack CAP Application Following SAP BTP Developerâ€™s Guide](https://developers.sap.com/group.cap-application-full-stack.html) group.

    1. In SAP Business Application Studio, choose the icon to download dev space content.

        <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Download dev space content](./downloadproject.png)

        > Make sure the **IncidentManagement** dev space is in status **RUNNING**.

    2. Extract the **incident-management** folder from the downloaded archive.


3. Open a command line window in the folder where your application resides (for example, **incident-management** if developed from scratch or **incidents-app** if cloned from GitHub) and run the following command to open the project in VS Code:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

### Build images

[OPTION BEGIN [Node.js]]
>- Make sure you're logged in to your container registry.
>
>- If you're using any device with a non-x86 processor (e.g. MacBook M1/M2) you need to instruct Docker to use x86 images by setting the **DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM** environment variable using the command `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64`. Check [Environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/#environment-variables) for more info.
 
#### Build the CAP Node.js and the database image

1. In VS Code, choose **Terminal** &rarr; **New Terminal** and run the following command:

    ```bash
    cds add workzone-standard
    ```

2. In your terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This will install required dependencies and update the **package-lock.json** file of your project.

3. Create the productive CAP build for your application: 

    ```bash
    cds build --production
    ```

    The CAP build writes to the **gen/srv** folder.

4. Build the CAP Node.js image:

    ```bash
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-srv:<image-version> \
        --path gen/srv \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
    ```

    > Make sure to replace `<your-container-registry>` with your docker server URL and keep in mind that `<image version>` should be a string. 

    > Looking for your docker server URL?
    
    > The docker server URL is the same as the path used for docker login, so you can quickly check it by running the following command in your terminal:

    > ```json
    > cat ~/.docker/config.json
    > ```

    > In case you're using Docker Hub as your container registry, replace the placeholder `<your-container-registry>` with your Docker Hub user ID.

    > The pack CLI builds the image that contains the build result in the **gen/srv** folder and the required npm packages by using the [Cloud Native Buildpack for Node.JS](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/nodejs) provided by Paketo.

5. Build the database image:

    ```bash
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-hana-deployer:<image-version> \
        --path gen/db \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
    ```
    
    > Make sure to replace `<your-container-registry>` with the link to your container registry and keep in mind that `<image version>` should be a string. 

    > Looking for your docker server URL?
    
    > The docker server URL is the same as the path used for docker login, so you can quickly check it by running the following command in your terminal:

    > ```json
    > cat ~/.docker/config.json
    > ```

    > In case you're using Docker Hub as your container registry, replace the placeholder `<your-container-registry>` with your Docker Hub user ID.

####  Prepare the UI deployer image configuration and build the image

1. In the VS Code terminal, navigate to the **app/incidents** folder and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install && npm run build
    ```

3. Create a new file **xs-app.json** in **app/incidents/** and add the following code to it:

    ```json
    {
    "welcomeFile": "/index.html",
    "authenticationMethod": "route",
    "routes": [
        {
        "source": "^/odata/v4/processor/(.*)$",
        "destination": "srv-api",
        "authenticationType": "xsuaa"
        },
        {
        "source": "^/resources/(.*)$",
        "target": "/resources/$1",
        "authenticationType": "none",
        "destination": "ui5"
        },
        {
        "source": "^/test-resources/(.*)$",
        "target": "/test-resources/$1",
        "authenticationType": "none",
        "destination": "ui5"
        },
        {
        "source": "^(.*)$",
        "target": "$1",
        "service": "html5-apps-repo-rt",
        "authenticationType": "xsuaa"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    > In case the **xs-app.json** already exists, replace its content with the snippet above.

4. Open **app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json** and remove the leading `/` from the `uri` parameter.

    ```json[10]
    {
        "_version": "1.49.0",
        "sap.app": {
            "id": "ns.incidents",
            "type": "application",
            "i18n": "i18n/i18n.properties",
            ...
            "dataSources": {
                "mainService": {
                    "uri": "odata/v4/processor/",
                    "type": "OData",
                    "settings": {
                        "annotations": [],
                        "localUri": "localService/metadata.xml",
                        "odataVersion": "4.0"
                    }
                }
            },
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
    ```

    This is needed as the dataSource URIs must be relative to the base URL, which means there is no need for a slash as the first character.

    Check [Accessing Business Service UI](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/accessing-business-service-ui?locale=39723061bc4b4b679726b120cbefdf5a.html&q=base%20URL) for more information.

5. Add navigation configuration and deploy configuration to the **app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json** file:

    ```json[9-22,25-28]
    {
        "_version": "1.49.0",
        "sap.app": {
            "id": "ns.incidents",
            ...
            "dataSources": {
                ...
            },
            "crossNavigation": {
                "inbounds": {
                    "incidents-display": {
                        "semanticObject": "incidents",
                        "action": "display",
                        "title": "{{flpTitle}}",
                        "subTitle": "{{flpSubtitle}}",
                        "signature": {
                            "parameters": {},
                            "additionalParameters": "allowed"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        ...
        "sap.cloud": {
            "public": true,
            "service": "incidents"
        }
    }
    ```

6. Create a new folder **ui-resources** in your project's root folder.

    The HTML5 applications deployer looks for the **ui-resources** folder which has the static files of the HTML5 application.

7. Create a new file **package.json** inside the **ui-resources** folder and add the following code to the file:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "incident-management",
        "version": "0.0.1",
        "description": "A Fiori application.",
        "keywords": [
            "ui5",
            "openui5",
            "sapui5"
        ],
        "scripts": {
            "start": "node node_modules/@sap/html5-app-deployer/index.js",
            "build:ui5": "npm run build --prefix ../app/incidents --if-present",
            "copyzips": "copyfiles -f ../app/*/dist/*.zip ./resources/",
            "package": "run-s build:ui5 copyzips"
        },
        "dependencies": { 
            "@sap/html5-app-deployer": "^6.2.0" 
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "copyfiles": "^2.4.1",
            "npm-run-all": "^4.1.5"
        }
    }

    ```

8. In the VS Code terminal, navigate to the **ui-resources** folder and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install && npm run package
    ```

    This will build and copy the archive **nsincidents.zip** inside the **ui-resources/resources** folder.

9.  In the VS Code terminal, navigate back to the root folder of your project:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

10. Build the UI deployer image:

    ```bash
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-html5-deployer:<image-version> \
        --path ui-resources \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
    ```

    > Make sure to replace `<your-container-registry>` with the link to your container registry and keep in mind that `<image version>` should be a string. 
    
    > Looking for your docker server URL?
    
    > The docker server URL is the same as the path used for docker login, so you can quickly check it by running the following command in your terminal:

    > ```json
    > cat ~/.docker/config.json
    > ```

    > In case you're using Docker Hub as your container registry, replace the placeholder `<your-container-registry>` with your Docker Hub user ID.

[OPTION END]
[OPTION BEGIN [Java]]

####  Prepare the UI deployer image configuration and build the image

1. In the VS Code terminal, navigate to the **app/incidents** folder and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install && npm run build
    ```

3. Create a new file **xs-app.json** in **app/incidents/** and add the following code to it:

    ```json
    {
    "welcomeFile": "/index.html",
    "authenticationMethod": "route",
    "routes": [
        {
        "source": "^/odata/v4/processor/(.*)$",
        "destination": "srv-api",
        "authenticationType": "xsuaa"
        },
        {
        "source": "^/resources/(.*)$",
        "target": "/resources/$1",
        "authenticationType": "none",
        "destination": "ui5"
        },
        {
        "source": "^/test-resources/(.*)$",
        "target": "/test-resources/$1",
        "authenticationType": "none",
        "destination": "ui5"
        },
        {
        "source": "^(.*)$",
        "target": "$1",
        "service": "html5-apps-repo-rt",
        "authenticationType": "xsuaa"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    > In case the **xs-app.json** already exists, replace its content with the snippet above.

4. Open **app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json** and remove the leading `/` from the `uri` parameter.

    ```json[10]
    {
        "_version": "1.49.0",
        "sap.app": {
            "id": "ns.incidents",
            "type": "application",
            "i18n": "i18n/i18n.properties",
            ...
            "dataSources": {
                "mainService": {
                    "uri": "odata/v4/ProcessorService/",
                    "type": "OData",
                    "settings": {
                        "annotations": [],
                        "localUri": "localService/metadata.xml",
                        "odataVersion": "4.0"
                    }
                }
            },
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
    ```

    This is needed as the dataSource URIs must be relative to the base URL, which means there is no need for a slash as the first character.

    Check [Accessing Business Service UI](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/accessing-business-service-ui?locale=39723061bc4b4b679726b120cbefdf5a.html&q=base%20URL) for more information.

5. Add navigation configuration and deploy configuration to the **app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json** file:

    ```json[9-22,25-28]
    {
        "_version": "1.49.0",
        "sap.app": {
            "id": "ns.incidents",
            ...
            "dataSources": {
                ...
            },
            "crossNavigation": {
                "inbounds": {
                    "incidents-display": {
                        "semanticObject": "incidents",
                        "action": "display",
                        "title": "{{flpTitle}}",
                        "subTitle": "{{flpSubtitle}}",
                        "signature": {
                            "parameters": {},
                            "additionalParameters": "allowed"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        ...
        "sap.cloud": {
            "public": true,
            "service": "incidents"
        }
    }
    ```

6. Create a new folder **ui-resources** in your project's root folder.

    The HTML5 applications deployer looks for the **ui-resources** folder which has the static files of the HTML5 application.

7. Create a new file **package.json** inside the **ui-resources** folder and add the following code to the file:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "incident-management",
        "version": "0.0.1",
        "description": "A Fiori application.",
        "keywords": [
            "ui5",
            "openui5",
            "sapui5"
        ],
        "scripts": {
            "start": "node node_modules/@sap/html5-app-deployer/index.js",
            "build:ui5": "npm run build --prefix ../app/incidents --if-present",
            "copyzips": "copyfiles -f ../app/*/dist/*.zip ./resources/",
            "package": "run-s build:ui5 copyzips"
        },
        "dependencies": { 
            "@sap/html5-app-deployer": "^6.2.0" 
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "copyfiles": "^2.4.1",
            "npm-run-all": "^4.1.5"
        }
    }

    ```

8. In the VS Code terminal, navigate to the **ui-resources** folder and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install && npm run package
    ```

    This will build and copy the archive **nsincidents.zip** inside the **ui-resources/resources** folder.

9.  In the VS Code terminal, navigate back to the root folder of your project:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

10. Build the UI deployer image:

    ```bash
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-html5-deployer:<image-version> \
        --path ui-resources \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
    ```

    > Make sure to replace `<your-container-registry>` with the link to your container registry and keep in mind that `<image version>` should be a string. 
    
    > Looking for your docker server URL?
    
    > The docker server URL is the same as the path used for docker login, so you can quickly check it by running the following command in your terminal:

    > ```json
    > cat ~/.docker/config.json
    > ```

    > In case you're using Docker Hub as your container registry, replace the placeholder `<your-container-registry>` with your Docker Hub user ID.
[OPTION END]

### Add Helm chart

CAP provides a configurable Helm chart for Node.js applications.


1. Run the following command in your project root folder: 

    ```bash
    cds add helm --y
    ```

    As a result, you'll see a newly-created **chart** folder in your project. The **chart** folder holds the helm configuration, including the **values.yaml** file where you'll add your container image settings later on.

2. Add your container image settings to your **chart/values.yaml** file:

    ```yaml[6,7]
    global:
      domain: 
      imagePullSecret:
        name: 
      image:
        registry: <your-container-registry>
        tag: <image-version>
    ```

    > Make sure to replace `<your-container-registry>` with the link to your container registry and keep in mind that `<image version>` should be a string. 

    > If you'd like to overwrite the global image version, you can add a tag for each image. Here's an example:
    >
    > ```yaml[4]
    > srv:
    >   image:
    >     repository: incident-management-srv
    >     tag: <incident-management-srv-image-version>
    > ```

3. Change the value of `SAP_CLOUD_SERVICE` to `incidentmanagementservice`:

    ```yaml[3]
    html5-apps-deployer:
      env:
        SAP_CLOUD_SERVICE: incidentmanagementservice
    ```

4. Run the following command to get the domain name of your Kyma cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl get gateway -n kyma-system kyma-gateway \
            -o jsonpath='{.spec.servers[0].hosts[0]}'
    ```

    Result should look like this:

    ```bash
    *.<xyz123>.kyma.ondemand.com
    ```

    > `<xyz123>` is a placeholder for a string of characters that's unique for your cluster.

5. Add the result without the leading `*.` in the `domain` property to the **chart/values.yaml** file so that the URL of your CAP service can be generated:

    ```yaml[2]
    global:
        domain: <your-cluster-domain>
    ...
    ```

6. Replace `<your-cluster-domain>` with your cluster domain in the `xsuaa` section of the **chart/values.yaml** file:

    ```yaml[9]
    xsuaa:
      serviceOfferingName: xsuaa
      servicePlanName: application
      parameters:
        xsappname: incidents
        tenant-mode: dedicated
        oauth2-configuration:
          redirect-uris:
            - https://*.<your-cluster-domain>/**

    ```

    > In case the `oauth2-configuration:` section is missing from your `values.yaml` file, make sure to add it altogether like that:
    >
    > ```yaml[7-9]
    >   xsuaa:
    >       serviceOfferingName: xsuaa
    >       servicePlanName: application
    >       parameters:
    >           xsappname: incidents
    >           tenant-mode: dedicated
    >           oauth2-configuration:
    >               redirect-uris:
    >                   - https://*.<your-cluster-domain>/**
    >```

7. Add the destinations under `backendDestinations` in the **chart/values.yaml** file:

    ```yaml[2,3]
    backendDestinations:
      srv-api:
        service: srv
    ```

    > The parameter `service` points to the deployment name whose URL will be used for this destination.

### Deploy CAP Helm chart

[OPTION BEGIN [Node.js]]
1. Update the productive CAP build for your application: 

    ```bash
    cds build --production
    ```

2. Run the following command to create a namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace incident-management
    kubectl label namespace incident-management istio-injection=enabled
    ```

3. Make sure your SAP HANA Cloud instance is running. Free tier HANA instances are stopped overnight.

    > Your SAP HANA Cloud service instance will be automatically stopped overnight, according to the server region time zone. That means you need to restart your instance every day before you start working with it.
    >
    > You can either use SAP BTP cockpit or the terminal in the SAP Business Application Studio to restart the stopped instance:
    >
    > ```bash
    > cf update-service incident-management -c '{"data":{"serviceStopped":false}}'
    > ```

3. Deploy using the Helm command:

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install incident-management --namespace incident-management ./gen/chart \
    --set-file xsuaa.jsonParameters=xs-security.json
    ```

    This installs the Helm chart from the **chart** folder with the release name **incident-management** in the namespace **incident-management**.

    > With the ***helm upgrade --install*** command you can install a new chart as well as upgrade an existing chart.

    The outcome of installation looks like this:

    <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Deployed app](./deployedapp.png)

<!-- 6. Enter the route displayed for **srv** in your browser. -->

<!-- border; size:540px ![Depoyed app route](./deployedapp-route.png) -->

<!--     You see the CAP start page: -->

<!-- border; size:540px ![CAP start page](./cap-start-page.png) --> 

<!-- 4. When you choose the **Incidents** service entity, you will see an error message.  -->

<!-- border; size:540px  ![401 error](./401-error.png) -->

In the next tutorial, you will access your UIs from SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition. The SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition will trigger the authentication flow to provide the required token to access the service.
