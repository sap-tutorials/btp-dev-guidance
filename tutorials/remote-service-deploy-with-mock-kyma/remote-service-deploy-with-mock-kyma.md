> This tutorial follows the guidance provided in the [SAP BTP Developer's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/what-is-btp-developers-guide).

### Build images

>- Make sure you're logged in to your Kyma cluster. See [Login to your Kyma cluster](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/deploy-to-kyma.html#a6e029c1-6e72-408b-bf5f-3b9dffba3499) for detailed steps how to log in.
>
>- Make sure you're logged in to your container registry.
>
>- If you're using any device with a non-x86 processor (for example, MacBook M1/M2), you need to instruct Docker to use x86 images by setting the **DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM** environment variable using the command `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64`. Check [Environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/#environment-variables) for more info.



1. In VS Code, open the **package.json** file and add the `[production]` profile `credentials` (`destination` and `path`) to the settings for **API_BUSINESS_PARTNER**:

    ```json
      "API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
        "kind": "odata", 
        "model": "srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER", 
        "[production]": { 
          "credentials": { 
            "destination": "<destination_name>",
            "path": "odata/v2/api-business-partner"
          }
        }
      }
    ```

    > Replace **<destination_name>** with the name of the destination that you created at **Step 5: Create a destination to the mock server** of [Install a Mock Server in the SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](remote-service-set-up-mock-kyma).


3. Create the productive CAP build for your application: 

    ```bash
    cds build --production
    ```

    The CAP build writes to the **gen/srv** folder.

4. Build a new version of the CAP Node.js image:

    ```bash
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-srv:<new-image-version> \
        --path gen/srv \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
    ```

    >- Make sure to replace `<your-container-registry>` with your docker server URL. 
    > 
    >- Keep in mind that `<new-image-version>` is a string that’s different from the string defined in [Deploy in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](deploy-to-kyma) to reflect the changes in the Incident Management app. 

    > Looking for your docker server URL?
    
    > The docker server URL is the same as the path used for docker login, so you can quickly check it by running the following command in your terminal:

    > ```json
    > cat ~/.docker/config.json
    > ```

    > In case you're using Docker Hub as your container registry, replace the placeholder `<your-container-registry>` with your Docker Hub user ID.

    > The pack CLI builds the image that contains the build result in the **gen/srv** folder and the required npm packages by using the [Cloud Native Buildpack for Node.JS](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/nodejs) provided by Paketo.


7. In the VS Code terminal, navigate to the **ui-resources** folder and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install && npm run package
    ```

    This command builds and copies the archive **nsincidents.zip** inside the **ui-resources/resources** folder.

8. In the VS Code terminal, navigate back to the root folder of your project:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

9. Build the UI deployer image:

    ```bash
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-html5-deployer:<image-version> \
        --path ui-resources \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
    ```

    >- Make sure to replace `<your-container-registry>` with the link to your container registry and keep in mind that `<image-version>` is a string. 
    
    >- Keep in mind that `<new-image-version>` is a string that’s different from the string defined in [Deploy in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](deploy-to-kyma) to reflect the changes in the Incident Management app. 
    
    > Looking for your docker server URL?
    
    > The docker server URL is the same as the path used for docker login, so you can quickly check it by running the following command in your terminal:

    > ```json
    > cat ~/.docker/config.json
    > ```

    > In case you're using Docker Hub as your container registry, replace the placeholder `<your-container-registry>` with your Docker Hub user ID.

Since the database image is unchanged, you don't need to build it again.

### Deploy the Incident Management application

1. Check your container image settings to your **chart/values.yaml** file:

    ```yaml
    global:
      domain: 
      imagePullSecret:
        name: 
      image:
        registry: <your-container-registry>
        tag: <image-version>
    ```

    > Make sure to replace `<your-container-registry>` with the link to your container registry and keep in mind that `<image version>` is a string. 


2. Overwrite the global image version for the CAP Node.js image and for the UI deployer image:
    
    ```yaml
    srv:
      image:
        repository: incident-management-srv
        tag: <new-image-version>
    ...
    html5-apps-deployer:
      ...
      image:
        repository: "incident-management-html5-deployer"
        tag: <new-image-version>
    ```

1. Update the productive CAP build for your application: 

    ```bash
    cds build --production
    ```

3. Make sure that your SAP HANA Cloud instance is running. Free tier HANA instances are stopped overnight.

    > Your SAP HANA Cloud service instance is automatically stopped overnight, according to the time zone of the region where the server is located. That means you need to restart your instance every day before you start working with it.
    >
    > You can either use the SAP BTP cockpit or the terminal in the SAP Business Application Studio to restart the stopped instance:
    >
    > ```bash
    > cf update-service incident-management -c '{"data":{"serviceStopped":false}}'
    > ```

3. Deploy using the Helm command:

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install incident-management --namespace incident-management ./gen/chart \
    --set-file xsuaa.jsonParameters=xs-security.json
    ```

    This command installs the Helm chart with the release name **incident-management** in the namespace **incident-management**.

### Test the Incident Management application

When creating new entries in the Incident Management application, you see all values from the mock server in the value help of the **Customer** field.

> Before you continue with this step, don’t forget to perform the steps from the tutorials [Assign the User Roles](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/user-role-assignment.html) and [Integrate Your Application Deployed in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime with SAP Build Work Zone, Standard Edition](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/integrate-with-work-zone-kymaruntime.html).
