[OPTION BEGIN [Common Data Model]]

The Common Data Model (CDM) is the basis for interoperability and content federation of business content from various SAP and third-party products, all integrated in a unified manner in one site that serves as a central entry point. Business content items such as roles, catalogs, groups, spaces, and pages can be included in the CDM. For this purpose, developers must specify the business content of the site in a **cdm.json** file that is part of the multitarget application (MTA) and also define design-time and runtime destinations in the **mta.yaml** file. For more information, see [Developing HTML5 Business Solutions as Content Providers](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-advanced-edition/sap-build-work-zone-advanced-edition/developing-html5-apps-for-cross-subaccount-consumption) and [About the Common Data Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-advanced-edition/sap-build-work-zone-advanced-edition/creating-cdm-json-file-for-multi-tenancy-html5-app).


#### Create the CDM configuration

1. Create a new folder **workzone** in the root of your project.

2. Create file **cdm.json** in the **workzone** folder and paste the following code snippet in the file:

    ```json
    [
        {
        "_version": "3.0",
        "identification": {
            "id": "defaultCatalogId",
            "title": "{{title}}",
            "entityType": "catalog"
        },
        "payload": {
            "viz": [
            {
                "appId": "ns.incidents",
                "vizId": "incidents-display"
            }
            ]
        },
        "texts": [
            {
            "locale": "",
            "textDictionary": {
                "title": "Default Catalog Title"
            }
            }
        ]
        },
        {
        "_version": "3.0",
        "identification": {
            "id": "defaultGroupId",
            "title": "{{title}}",
            "entityType": "group"
        },
        "payload": {
            "viz": [
            {
                "appId": "ns.incidents",
                "vizId": "incidents-display"
            }
            ]
        },
        "texts": [
            {
            "locale": "",
            "textDictionary": {
                "title": "Business Apps"
            }
            }
        ]
        },
        {
        "_version": "3.0",
        "identification": {
            "id": "defaultRole",
            "entityType": "role",

            {
                "id": "ns.incidents"
            }
            ],
            "catalogs": [
            {
                "id": "defaultCatalogId"
            }
            ],
            "groups": [
            {
                "id": "defaultGroupId"
            }
            ]
        }
        }
    ]
    ```

#### Update the mta.yaml file

1. Add `html5-repo-runtime` under resources:

    ```yaml[3-7]
       resources:
        ...
        - name: incident-management-html5-repo-runtime
          type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
          parameters:
            service: html5-apps-repo
            service-plan: app-runtime
    ```

2. Update the `incident-management-destinations` module:

    1. Add the `incidents-html-repo-runtime` to the `requires` section:

        ```yaml[4-7]
        - name: incident-management-destinations
          type: com.sap.application.content
          requires:
          - name: incident-management-html5-repo-runtime
            parameters:
              service-key: 
                name: incident-management-html5-repo-runtime-service-key
        ```

    3. Add the following code snippet for subaccount destinations in the `parameters.content` section:

        ```yaml[7-12]
        - name: incident-management-destinations
          type: com.sap.application.content
          requires:
          ...
          parameters:
            content:
                subaccount:
                    destinations:
                    - Name: incident-management-cdm
                      ServiceInstanceName: incident-management-html5-repo-runtime
                      ServiceKeyName: incident-management-html5-repo-runtime-service-key
                      URL: https://html5-apps-repo-rt.${default-domain}/applications/cdm/<cloud-service-name>
                instance:
                    existing_destinations_policy: update
                    destinations:
                    ...
        ```
    
    > You can find the value for `<cloud-service-name>` in the **app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json** file.
    > ```json[3]
    > "sap.cloud": {
    >    "public": true,
    >    "service": "incidentmanagement.service"
    >}
    >```
    

4. Update the `incident-management-destination` resource:

    1. Add the following code snippet for destinations to the `parameters.config.init_data` section:

        ```[8-15]
        - name: incident-management-destination
          type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
          parameters:
            ...
            config:
            ...
              init_data:
                subaccount:
                  destinations:
                  - Name: incident-management-rt
                    Authentication: NoAuthentication
                    ProxyType: Internet
                    Type: HTTP
                    URL: https://<subdomain>.launchpad.${default-domain}
                    CEP.HTML5contentprovider: true
                instance:
                  existing_destinations_policy: update
                  destinations:
                  ...
        ```

        > Replace `<subdomain>` with your SAP BTP account's subdomain. You can find the subdomain in the **Overview** page in SAP BTP cockpit. 

5. Create a new module `incident-management-workzone-cdm` to add the CDM Configuration from the **cdm.json** file as part of the `incident-management-app-deployer`.

    ```yaml
      - name: incident-management-workzone-cdm
        type: html5
        path: workzone
        build-parameters:
          build-result: .
          supported-platforms:
            []
    ```

5. Update the `incident-management-app-deployer` module:

    1. Update (`path`, `build-result`, and `target-path` parameters) of the `incident-management-app-deployer` module as follows:

        ```yaml
        - name: incident-management-app-deployer
          type: com.sap.application.content
          path: gen
          ...
          build-parameters:
            build-result: app/
            requires:
              - name: incidentmanagementincidents
                artifacts:
                  - incidents.zip
                target-path: app/
        ```
        <!--  - the name of the destination inserted here should be the same as in the **xsapp.json** file `destination` parameter in the `routes` section. -->

    1. Add the following lines to the `requires` section:

        ```yaml[5-6]
          - name: incident-management-app-deployer
            type: com.sap.application.content
            path: gen
            requires:
              - name: incident-management-auth
              - name: incident-management-destination
        ```

    2. Add the following to the `build-parameters.requires  ` section:

        ```yaml
          - name: incident-management-workzone-cdm
            artifacts:
              - cdm.json
            target-path: app/
        ```

6. Verify. Here's how your **mta.yaml** file looks like at this stage:

    ```yaml
    _schema-version: 3.3.0
    ID: incident-management
    version: 1.0.0
